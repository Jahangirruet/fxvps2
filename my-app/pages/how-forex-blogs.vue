                Day by day as the technology rapidly advances forward, business
                infrastructure is getting complex. Business now days does not
                necessarily need to be in physical place. VPS (Virtual Private
                Server) is serving that purpose and forex trading became more
                popular as the forex & VPS is combined together.
                <br /><br />
                For having a clear insight about VPS and its relation with forex
                trading, first we need to understand what web hosting is.

                  Suppose you want to run a grocery store or any business which
                  is related with goods in the real world. For setting up the
                  business and selling the goods, a physical location is a must.
                  People who goes around your business location can easily see
                  that what you are doing.
                  <br /><br />
                  Similarly, if you want to run an online business, the contents
                  of your website requires a live place where people can see you
                  & your business on the internet. That’s when it is necessary
                  to put all your contents on a server, so that your website
                  will go live on the internet. The way the server is making
                  your site live is called web hosting.

                  To run a website, a server is necessary from where it can be
                  live on the internet. Usually a server is made of powerful
                  processing power, more ram & vast storage system. When this
                  single large server is divided into multiple independent mini
                  servers, each mini server is called “Virtual private server
                  (VPS)”.
                  <br /><br />
                  Each virtual private server has its own resources like
                  processing power unit, RAM, operating system (OS) & storage
                  capacity.

                  Imagine you are continuously sitting in front of your computer
                  all day and analyzing the market trend for taking correct
                  bidding. You may be awake for one day, three days a week but
                  what about a month or whole year! It’s impossible.
                  <br /><br />
                  According to Scientific American, a research was conducted and
                  concluded that- “Average human can stay awake for 8 to 10
                  days”
                  <br /><br />
                  To solve the continuous interaction, now forex trading can be
                  done via Expert advisor or automated trading engine that is
                  hosted on a virtual private server (VPS) for the 100% uptime.
                  <br /><br />
                  Expert advisor or automated trade engine is a specialized
                  software that works based on mathematical algorithms and
                  parameter set by the trader. Such as meta trader 4, meta
                  trader 5 etc.

                  faster in sending orders, less delays and slippage. When a
                  trade’s expected price is different than the price when the
                  trade is executed is called slippage.
