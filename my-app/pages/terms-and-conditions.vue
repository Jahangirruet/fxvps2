                FXVPS.PRO provides virtualized server instances (virtual
                machines or VMs), which are allocated portions of the physical
                hardware resources of host machines. FXVPS.PRO’s virtualization
                platform is designed to guarantee the availability of resource
                allocations provided for each VM; however, it is possible that 1
                VM may abuse system resources by demanding an over-allocation of
                host system resources, in a way that negatively impacts the
                performance of neighboring VMs. Resource allocation and
                utilization will be continuously monitored by FXVPSPRO, in order
                to prevent the possibility of resource abuse. FXVPS.PRO may
                immediately suspend any VM that is seen to be abusing host
                system or network resources in the manner described above.

                Suspension of Service

              <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-black !leading-[1.6]">
                FXVPS.PRO reserves the right to suspend network access to any
                subscriber if, in the judgment of FXVPS.PRO, the subscriber’s
                account is the source or target of a violation of any of the
                terms of the ToS, or for any other reason which FXVPS.PRO deems
                necessary to guarantee the stability of customer services. If
                inappropriate or illegal activity is detected or brought to our
                attention by a third party, all accounts of the subscriber in
                question will be deactivated until an investigation has been
                completed. Multiple violations of the ToS will result in
                permanent suspension of the related account, without any option
                for refund. With complaints of infringing or illegal content, a
                single complaint may be deemed sufficient for permanent
                suspension of the alleged infringing product. If multiple
                complaints of infringing or illegal content are received
                involving two or more products, all products under that
                customer’s ownership and/or control are subject to permanent
                suspension. Prior notification to the subscriber is not assured.
                In extreme cases, law enforcement will be contacted regarding
                the activity. The subscriber may not be credited for the time
                the subscriber’s machines were suspended if the subscriber is
                found to be at fault.

                This ToS specifically prohibits the use of FXVPS.PRO services
                for illegal or otherwise malicious activities. The subscriber
                agrees that FXVPS.PRO may disclose any and all subscriber
                information, including assigned IP numbers, account history,
                billing records, etc., to any court or law enforcement agency

                warrant or other court order, without consent or notification to
                the subscriber.

                Each party (the “Indemnifying Party”) hereby indemnifies the

                expense (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising from any
                claim, demand, action or proceeding based upon the alleged
                breach or untruthfulness of any of the Indemnifying Party’s

                avoidance of any such claim, provided, however, that the
                Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice to the Indemnifying
                Party of the assertion of any such claims and provided further
                that Indemnifying Party shall have the right to select counsel
                and control the defense thereof, subject to right of the
                Indemnified Party to participate therein.

                limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable,
                then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed,
                and enforced as so limited.
