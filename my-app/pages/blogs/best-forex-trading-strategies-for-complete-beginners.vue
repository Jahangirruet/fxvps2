                applies to every aspect of events in life. Risk-taking is the
                first footstep of every successful story but in the financial
                market, calculated risk is the key.

                For the beginners, the Forexmarket may look like a complete
                maze. Dizzying about where to play the first shot, when to hit,
                when to let go and what will be the game plan. Here’s a
                comprehensive guideline is laid out for the complete beginners

                  When you have a losing side, don’t put all in to try to make
                  it back in one shot like poker. It’s always wise to keep going
